# Mice-and-Mystics
A simple Java text adventure

All code obviously located in src/
All .txt files are located at root so that Eclipse can easily use them as program arguments.
These .txt files represent the various "decks" of the Mice and Mystics game and new entries must be formatted according to each deck's rules.
